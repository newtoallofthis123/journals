# Wednesday as Always

You know how people always talk about #ModayMotivation. Yes. That happens on wednesdays for me. If you look at my GitHub commit history, you will find that I commit most on wednesdays, especially at night. I have never been able to figure out why. I guess it's like mid week motivation.

Anyways, let me explain why that's relavant. I always wanted a journal for well, journalling my thoughts. I don't want all my pent up thoughts to just erupt at the next person I talk to. Spoiler alert they still do. Just ask my friends and family. I talk alot. So, why not convert all the talk into JSON code that is stored in binary on cdn servers of GitHub around the world.

Yeah where was I, yes. I always wanted to implement a journal in my site. However, quering the database everytime was turning out to be quite costly for the website speed, so I had to keep the journal on the hold. I recently got the idea to just use GitHub. 

We all use GitHub for storing files and pictures. So, why not just come up with a hash syntax for the files and use the https://raw.githubusercontent.com domain to get all the contents of the file.

Hence, welcome to this journal, powered by GitHub.

It felt good programming after a long time. I recently wrote in one of my updates that I wanted to concentrate on my health ([Read it Here](/updates/some-time-off)). I still am, but my walking and jogging has been put on hold for this week due to the hot weather. I am unable to sleep early as it is quite humid at night. So, coding it is for now.

Anyways, It is quite late already, hope you have a great day or a good night,
