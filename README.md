# Hey Diary

Yes and by diary I mean you the reader. Hello! I am Ishan and this is my journal. I sounded way too cheerful in the sentence, so let me dial it down a bit. Anyways, what's up bruh. I am Ishan. I have a lot of random thoughts and even though I have wonderful family and friends, it just hits different when you journal "apparently".

So I wanted to try that out.

Now I did want to try it out, but did I want to make another costly database operation to the website everytime I load it? No. Then I had the idea to just use someone else's processing power. So, sorry GitHub, I choose you.

Yes. I use GitHub to host all my markdown files in a orderly fashion based on something I call the date hash, which is basically `{yyyymmdd}.md`. Now the nextjs app/ directory introduces calling async functions directly, so it made by coding even simpler.

Anyways, this is just the test draft. Yes. Even the front page is controlled by GitHub. :)
